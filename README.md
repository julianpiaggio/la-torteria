### Week
In this section, the content that is acquired will be uploaded and will be divided into weeks.

### Week 1 🕐
In this first week there was an intensive review of the previously acquired knowledge about html, css, javascript, etc.
In addition, the history and principles of REACT were discussed. We also perform the installation of those dependencies necessary for the start of the course and the app itself.

### Week 2 🕐
In the second week we start working on the code itself, knowing how the code is applied in the app, the formats in which it must be manipulated, the compilers, etc.
Progress was made in the concept of components, their importance within react and their creation and composition.
Also this week the first pre-delivery of the final project was enabled.

### Week 3 🕐
In the third week we continue to expand knowledge about components, life cycles, as well as the application of events, properties, states, etc.
We also work on promises, asynchrony and map.

### Week 4 🕐

In the second part we learned about routes in our project, using the REACT-ROUTER-DOM tool.
The second pre-delivery of the final project was enabled

### Week 5 🕐
In week 5 we work with events, the types and their implementation. Event-driven component design.
In the second part we learned the use of the CONTEXT, the relationship within the app, the dynamism, how to apply it, etc.

### Week 6 🕐
In week 6 we work on rendering techniques, conditional rendering, render optimization, etc.
We also implemented the use of a noSQL database, in this case FIREBASE, we saw its configuration, consumption from the app, creation of collections, documents, etc.
